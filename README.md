# qsarify

qsarify is a library of tools for the analysis of QSAR/QSPR datasets and models. This library is intended to be used to produce models which relate a set of calculated chemical descriptors to a given numeric endpoint. Many great tools will take the geometry or string data of a given chemical and compute **descriptors**, which are numeric measures of the properties of these, but you can generate some of these with another one of my scripts, [Free Descriptors](https://github.com/StephenSzwiec/free_descriptors).

# Dependencies

- Python 3
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)


# Installation

`pip install qsarify`

# What is included right now?

- Data preprocessing tools: `data_tools`
- Dimensionality reduction via clustering: `clustering`
- Feature selection:
	- Single threaded: `feature_selection_single`
	- Multi-threaded: `feature_selection_multi`
- Model Export and Visualization: `model_export`
- Cross Valiidation: `cross_validation`

# How to use

The best way to learn how to use this library is to look at the example notebook in the `examples` folder. This notebook will walk you through the workflow of using this library to build a QSAR model.

# Future Plans

- Massively parallel feature selection methods:
	- CUDA acceleration
	- MPI acceleration
- Include Shannon Entropy as a dimensionality reduction metric in clustering
- Embedded kernel methods
- More visualization tools
- More cross validation tools
- Feature selection tools for categorical data
